# Assignment 4 – Portfolio Website

## Project Description
This is an upgraded and fully improved version of my personal portfolio website.  
It now includes new UI enhancements, mobile responsiveness, dynamic behavior, and a live deployment.  
The goal of this project is to create a polished, professional, and interactive portfolio that showcases my work effectively.

###  New Features & Improvements
