# AI Usage Report

## Tools Used
**ChatGPT & Cursor AI**  
Used for debugging JavaScript, improving UI layout, explaining errors, and guiding implementation of features such as:
- GitHub API integration  
- Theme toggle (with LocalStorage)  
- Search filter logic  
- Greeting system improvements  
- Contact tooltip behavior  
- Responsive design for mobile  
- Code cleanup and refactoring  
- Deployment setup on Vercel  

## Benefits
- Faster debugging and clearer understanding of logic  
- Cleaner and more readable code structure  
- Better UI/UX decisions for spacing, buttons, and mobile layout  
- Helped identify unused code and safely remove it  
- Provided deployment instructions and fixes  

## Challenges
- Some AI suggestions were too advanced and needed simplification  
- Responsive design fixes required manual adjustments  
- API handling needed testing and refinement  
- Needed to modify generated code to match assignment structure  

## Learning Outcomes
- Stronger understanding of DOM manipulation and APIs  
- Improved debugging and refactoring skills  
- Better knowledge of responsive design principles  
- Learned proper deployment workflow (GitHub → Vercel)  
- Gained experience in evaluating and modifying AI-generated code  

## Responsible Use
- Tested and verified all AI suggestions manually  
- Only kept code I fully understand and can explain  
- Ensured the final project meets assignment rules and requirements  
- AI was used as a helper, not a shortcut
